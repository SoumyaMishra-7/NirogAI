# Multilingual AI Chatbot for Preventive Healthcare

## Project Overview
Our hackathon project focuses on a **multilingual AI chatbot** designed to help people in **rural and semi-urban areas** access preventive healthcare information. Many people in these areas struggle because:

- They don’t always have reliable access to doctors or clinics.
- Healthcare information is usually available only in English or Hindi, not in their local dialects.
- Even if information is available, low literacy levels make it hard to understand.

This chatbot bridges that gap by providing **simple, clear, and personalized health guidance** in multiple local languages, making it easy for people to understand and act on.

## Key Features

- **Language Accessibility:** Supports multiple languages and dialects for natural interaction.
- **Offline / Low-Bandwidth Use:** Designed to work even in areas with poor internet connectivity.
- **Practical Healthcare Support:** Focuses on awareness, reminders for vaccinations, preventive tips, and health education (not diagnosing diseases).
- **Engagement Features:** Voice input for non-typers, interactive quizzes, and infographics for low literacy users.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Simple and clean interface for first-time users.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express APIs for handling chats, reminders, and alerts.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas for scalability and reliability.
- **AI/NLP Engine:** Rasa, Dialogflow CX, and IndicNLP to understand multiple languages and code-switching.
- **Communication Tools:** Twilio for sending SMS and WhatsApp messages.

## Hackathon Prototype

During the hackathon, we will demonstrate:

1. A working chatbot that answers health-related questions in local languages.
2. Preventive healthcare tips and vaccination reminders.
3. Multilingual input handling, offline-friendly functionality, and simple yet impactful features.

## Social Impact

This project aims to make AI **inclusive and socially beneficial**. By targeting underserved communities, it can:

- Help rural families make informed health decisions.
- Reduce the burden of preventable diseases.
- Be scaled by governments and NGOs for wider community health programs.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Summary

> This project is not just about creating a “fancy AI bot,” but about using AI for **social impact**, empowering communities through **language-accessible healthcare awareness**.
